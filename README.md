# Customer Churn Prediction :office:

## Introduction :book:

This project involves building a predictive model to determine whether customers of a fictional telecommunications company will churn. Churn analysis is crucial for understanding why customers discontinue their services and what factors contribute to this decision. The dataset contains information about 7043 customers in California, including various demographic details, a Churn Score, and a Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.

## Project Structure :bookmark_tabs:

This project is organized as follows:
- Dataset: [Telco customer churn](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113)
- [Project](https://github.com/Waliid18/Classification-Project/blob/main/Classification_Project_Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb) : Classification_Project_Customer_Churn_Prediction
- [README.md](https://github.com/Waliid18/Classification-Project/edit/main/README.md): This file, providing an overview of the project. :link:

## Analysis and Modeling :gear:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Examined the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Identified potential issues like missing data and incorrect data types.
   - Used visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** 
   - Cleaned the data to ensure it was suitable for modeling.
   - Identification of key features contributing to customer churn.

3. **Model Comparison:**
   - Compared three classification models: KNN Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
   - Evaluated models using GridSearchCV and selected the best-performing model.

4. **Final Model Testing:**
   - Tested the final model by making predictions on new input data.
  
## Results :memo:

The final model demonstrated strong performance metrics, indicating its effectiveness in identifying customers who are likely to churn. 

## Conclusion :page_facing_up:

By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, the company can take proactive measures to reduce churn rates, ultimately leading to increased customer retention and revenue.
