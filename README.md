# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project involves building a predictive model to determine whether customers of a fictional telecommunications company will churn. Churn analysis is crucial for understanding why customers discontinue their services and what factors contribute to this decision. The dataset contains information about 7043 customers in California, including various demographic details, a Satisfaction Score, a Churn Score, and a Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `Classification_Project.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and modeling process.

## Analysis and Modeling

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Examined the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Identified potential issues like missing data and incorrect data types.
   - Used visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Cleaned the data to ensure it was suitable for modeling.
   - Performed feature engineering to create new features.

3. **Model Comparison:**
   - Compared three classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluated models using cross-validation and selected the best-performing model.

4. **Final Model Testing:**
   - Tested the final model by making predictions on new input data.

## Results

The final model demonstrated strong performance metrics, indicating its effectiveness in identifying customers who are likely to churn. This model can be used by the telecommunications company to implement targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, the company can take proactive measures to reduce churn rates, ultimately leading to increased customer retention and revenue.
